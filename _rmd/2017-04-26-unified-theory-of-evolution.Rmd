*Author's Note: This post was inspired by a recent discussion at the [PEGE Journal Club](https://pegejournalclub.wordpress.com/) at the [University of Stirling](https://www.stir.ac.uk/). A version of this post also appears on the journal club website.*

Conceptual unification of disparate phenomena is a major goal of theory in the natural sciences, and many of the most revolutionary scientific theories are those that have shown how seemingly disparate ideas and observations follow logically from a single unifying framework. The most momentus of these theories include Newton's unification of gravity and the laws of planetary motion [@Newton1999], Darwin's explanations of adaptation and biodiversity as following from natural selection and descent with modification, respectively [@Darwin1859], and Einstein's general relativity unifying gravity, space, and time [@Einstein1911]. In all of these examples, theory changed how scientists understand the world by revealing a fundamental concept, the consequences of which affected an entire field of study.

Perhaps to this list of discoveries we should include the unifying equation of George Price [-@Price1970] [[1]](#foot1), which, in a [recent paper](http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/690937) in the *American Naturalist*, [David Queller](https://wubio.wustl.edu/Queller) argues to be the most fundamental theorem of evolution [@Queller2017]. The Price equation as a unifying framework has been a subject of recent interest both within evolutionary biology [e.g., @Grafen2015; @Frank2012; @Luque2016] and across disciplines from mechanics [@Frank2015] to music [@MacCallum2012]. At its core, the Price equation is a unifying framework for understanding any correlated change between any two entities. @Queller2017 proposes it to be fundamental because it encompasses all evolutionary forces acting on a population, and because it can be used to derive other less general equations in population and quantitative genetics, all of which require stricter assumptions about the evolutionary forces and environmental conditions affecting entities in the population. The Price equation includes two terms to describe the change in any trait $\Delta$ *z*. 

![The Price equation](https://github.com/bradduthie/blog/blob/f73eb78aa2e4ce9c521fe6cf90185a678c65c0ed/figures/price_eqn.png?raw=true)

The first term islolates how a trait (*z*) covaries with fitness (*w*) for entities (*i*), and encompasses the evolutionary processes of natural selection and genetic drift. The second term encompasses everything else that affects trait change (often called the 'transmission bias'), such as mutation, selection at within-entity scales, or background changes in environment. Interpreting the Price equation can be a bit daunting at first, perhaps in part because of how abstract the entities (*i*) are -- representing anything from alleles, to unmeasured genotypes, to organisms, to even groups of organisms as the situation requires. Likewise, traits (*z*) can be any aspect of phenotype associated with such entities, including fitness (*w*) itself.

It's here where Queller's [-@Queller2017] synthesis really shines, as he carefully walks the reader through how Price's abstract equation can be used to derive multiple other less fundamental equations in which variables represent something concrete and measureable in empirical populations. These equations include Fischer's [-@Fisher1930] average excess equation describing allele frequency change in population genetics, the Robertson [-@Robertson1966] and breeder's equations [@Lush1937] of trait change in quantitative genetics, and Fischer's [-@Fisher1930] fundamental theorem of natural selection. In all cases, Queller [-@Queller2017] notes the additional assumptions that are required to use these equations, particularly that the second term of the Price equation equals zero meaning that no transmission bias exists. The end result is a synthesis that organises a set of equations that are familiar to evolutionary biologists in a way that follows logically from the fundamental equation of Price. 

Future directions for conceptual unification (**work in progress**)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The recent interest in the Price equation is encouraging for the further theoretical unification of the biological sciences, and Queller's [-@Queller2017] paper nicely complements a more philosophical analysis by [Victor Luque](https://victorjluque.wordpress.com/) [-@Luque2016]. It's important to keep in mind that the Price equation is, at its core, about correlated change between entities, and its application is not restricted to changing alleles or phenotypes. It can be applied equally well to non-biological entities if need be -- Price himself proposed the example of selecting radio stations with a turning dial [@Gardner2008]. Even within biology though, there seems to be scope for further conceptual unification, particularly between evolution and ecology. Extensions of the Price equation allow for selection across different levels of biological organisation and different classes within a population [@Heisler1987; @Grafen2015; @Rankin2015; @Queller2017]. Entities in the Price equation might therefore represent individuals grouped according to class or species, with fitness (*w*) defined by individual or group reproductive value [@Williams1966; @Grafen2015a] and the trait of interest (*z*) being, for example, group abundance. There is no reason that this wouldn't work in principle; the Price equation can handle covariation between any two traits, so a link between individual reproductive value and group abundance should be possible. From here, it might be possible to derive not just the fundamental equations of population and quantiative genetics, but potentially fundamental equations of population and community ecology, such as the modern version of [Lotka-Volterra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotka%E2%80%93Volterra_equations) competition below as appears in @Chesson2000b.

![Lotka-Volterra](https://github.com/bradduthie/blog/blob/f73eb78aa2e4ce9c521fe6cf90185a678c65c0ed/figures/modern_LV.png?raw=true)

How to get from the Price equation to Chesson's version of the Lotka-Volterra equation immediately above in a way that unifies ecological and evolutionary dynamics isn't immediately obvious to me. @Page2002 provide an interesting link between the Price equation and classical Lotka-Voltera dynamics through game theory. They note, essentially, that different species can be intepreted as different strategies whose fitness payoffs (in terms of reproductive rates) depend on the abundance of other strategies. They then show that the game-theoretic interpretation of Lotka-Volterra is equivalent to a continuous time version of the Price equation. The first term of the Price equation still describes selection, while the second term of the Price equation includes changes in a trait value (which can be interpreted as species abundance) caused by a varying environment or interactions between species (they also include a third term describing among-type mutation). @Page2002 do not break the equation down any further, but there would seem to be scope for expanding the second term of the Price equation to isolate the effects of species interactions on species abundance, perhaps as driven by environmental fluctuation [e.g., @Chesson1982; @Chesson1994; @Chesson1985; @Chesson2000a]. Interestingly, @Queller2017 suggests that there might ''also be candidates for fundamental-theorem status derived from the second term''. I don't yet know whether or not this is the case, but it would certainly be interesting if many fundamental theorems of population and community ecology could be derived from the Price equation with the second term doing most of the heavy lifting. 

<!---

One potential starting point could be to redefine the two traits of interest (*w* and *z*) and entities (*i*) in the Price equation, then try to link them to something very basic in population ecology, such as the logistic growth equation,

\Delta N_{i} = R_{i} N_{i} (1 - N_{i} \alpha_{ii})

Where N_{i} is the population size of species *i*, R_{i} is the discrete rate of increase of *i* (1 + Births - Deaths), and \alpha_{ii} is the intraspecific competition coefficient of *i* (which also equals the inverse of carrying capacity, *K*). 

If we want the Price equation to be truly unifying, then I think that we want to be able to index groups and potentially individuals (*i*, and perhaps later *i* and *j*). Additionally, we might not be so interested in any particular trait *z* so much as the abundance of individuals and species. There's no reason that *z*, typically interpreted as a trait value, can't be re-interpreted as something more like fitness. A link between evolutionary fitness and population dynamics might be possible using simple offspring number *m_{i}*, or perhaps reproductive value [@Williams1966], the latter of which has received some recent interest in the Price equation [but check on this @Grafen2015; @Grafen2015a]. Population dynamics, after all, is defined by the change in abundance or density of individuals in a particular species, and we might for simplicity assume that evolutionary fitness is defined by *m_{i}*. Hence we have the index *i* for individuals and *m_{i}* as fitness *in place of z rather than w*. Note that neither R_{i} nor \alpha_{ii} are good candidates to replace *w* because the represent statitic parameters of intrinsic growth and density effects, respectively. Instead, we might usefully define another variable to replace *w*, such as abiotic environment, which I'll define with a lower case 'e', e_{i}, interpreted as the abiotic environment experienced by *i*. We might then consider the starting point,

\Delta m_{i} = Cov(m_{i}, e_{i}) + E(m_{i} \delta e_{i}).

We could consider a static environment first, so the first term is zero because the environment does not vary.

- Perhaps first term could be how growth rate (reproductive value) covaries with environment (non-density dependent stuff)
- Second term would hold density-dependent interactions -- the *expected* change in trait (species abundance) caused by the number of other individuals and their interactions, non-additivies and competition coefficients.
- Then again, the environment shouldn't be a term because we want other species to be a term? But actually, we want to subdivide into groups of species, so really we want group and individual fitness with environment?
- Chesson's r_i = E_i - C_i might be more accurate; perhaps \deltaN_i = cov(N, Env) + E(N \delta Env) ? N could be expected equalibrium density (K?). This seems like the wrong direciton to go down though.
- Maybe we'd need to get at it less directly? Perhaps using reproductive values?
- \delta RV = cov(RV, Env) + E(RV \delta Env), where the second term could be broken down more somehow for density dependence. In any case, any interaction with another group is necessarily going to be density-dependent (including competition coefficients). The entities really should be individuals and groups (species); these entities shouldn't themselves be group-specific abundances, I don't think. Nor should they be abundance per-se if we want to break things down to the level of individuals in groups. I think reproductive value is really the way to go; it links nicely to evolutionary fitness, while group reproductive value could link clearly to what 'fitness' means in community ecology (see Chesson). Environment seems like an important thing in itself, with the environment that any individual 'i' experiencing being perhaps slightly different. The second term of the equation could be expanded to deal with density-dependent interactions?
- So: \delta RV_i = Cov(RV_i, Env_i) + E(RV_i \delta Env_i)
- The downside of the above is that Env_i doesn't have a nice analogue of Price -- it would be nice to keep fitness and traits, then actually move to the second term of the equation to do the community ecology.
- \delta Z = Cov(w, Z) + E(w, \delta Z), where the second term could define fitness as reproductive value, actually (or both could) -- at least to start with, then link that to population dynamics and Lotka-Volterra. Perhaps we assume that Cov(w, Z) = 0. Then expand the second equation to put things in terms of reproductive values affected by density-dependent effects (still tempted to use RV and Env.
- Note, however, that r_i is static in a single environment. So are competition coefficients; they don't change. Hence we need to changing things, and trying to get the logistic growth equation out of the Price equation wouldn't work because we don't have two covarying things. We might get to two species' abundances, but this wouldn't unify things well because we're really just looking at one strategy versus another in the same way as Page and Nowak (2002). If we want to make species groups of individuals, then it really might be useful to combine fitness with environment (since we're not predicting traits, unless we want to go multi-variate -- can we do that? Have multi-dimensional trait space and fitness?).
- Another way to look at it is that r_i = \delta RV and assume cov(RV, Z) = 0, and that all of the logistic growth equation is found in E(RV \delta Z). 
- How about: \delta N_i = Cov(r_i, N_i) + E(r_i \delta N_i) where E(r_i \delta N_i) = r_i(1 - N_i \alpha_{i,i}). The first term Cov(r_i, N_i) = 0 because intrinsic growth rate is always the same, while the second term can get to logistic growth. By using different subscripts, we could get to different species.
- Note that we've still got (1 / r_i) to deal with though -- not sure where this would go.

25 JUN 2017

The \Delta A can be decomposed into selection at the group (species) level, in the covariance term. The transmission error is where selection at the species level occurs, and this is how logistic growth equations can be replicated. There is no selection at the species level (only one species), so the first term is zero. In the second term, selection is broken down into individuals within the species, where there is a negative covariance between the \Delta A_j and A_j such that higher A_j values cause lower growth rate. 

In this case K (or \alpha) can be the environment, with fluctuations in it causing changes in selection at the within-species level in the second term of the Price equation. Surely we can get to \Delta N = r(1 - \alpha * N).

Communicating the fundamental theorem of evolution
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The status of the Price equation as a the fundamental theorem of evolution from which all other key equations in population and quantiative genetics can be derived also raises some pedagogical questions. I have taught a course on Biological Evolution to undergraduates a few times now (though not recently), in which students learned both the average excess equation of @Fisher1930 and the breeder's equation of @Lush1937. These equations were used and discussed in detail in the population genetics and quantitative genetics sections of the course, respectively, but without much attempt to synthesise across the two sub-disciplines. I believe it was particularly challenging for students to shift their thinking from the measured genotypes of population genetics to the more statistical thinking associated with quantitative traits [[2]](#foot2). The Price equation might be useful for giving students a clearer overview of population and quantitative genetics equations and how they relate to one another. I don't know if this would be best accomplished by explicitly starting off with the Price equation in the way that @Queller2017 does (which would seem daunting to say the least), or perhaps by instead presenting the concept of trait change under different, hierarchically organised, assumptions that can be addressed with different but inter-related equations. However it is accomplished, showing the link between these two sub-disciplines of evolutionary biology would almost certainly improve and reinforce students' understanding of evolution [@Leamnson2000].

For an introduction to both George Price and further explanation of the Price equation and its importance, see @Gardner2008.

<a name="foot2">[2]</a> I also recall this shift in thinking to be a bit challenging at first when I was an undergraduate myself. My first introduction to quantitative genetics was in undergraduate evolutionary biology, by which time I was familiar with population genetics and had learned quite a bit of evolutionary ecology. At first I tried to understand the breeder's equation on these terms, or to find some sort of conceptual link between them, so it took a bit of work for me to understand what was going on with selection on quantitative traits.

<!---  The second term seems particularly important because it includes non-additive effects and feedbacks, as Queller notes in the context of includive fitness theory. THese would be important for understanding community dynamics. --->
