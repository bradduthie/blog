For nearly three and a half years, the primary focus of my research was to develop theory on the evolution of biparental inbreeding at the [University of Aberdeen](http://abdn.ac.uk). Biparental inbreeding specifically refers to the situation in which two different, but genetically related, individuals of any given species breed and thereby produce inbred offspring. This situation differs from self-fertilisation, in which an individual inbreeds with itself, as is perhaps most commonly studied in plants [e.g., Barrett1996; @Vogler2001]. The addition of a second parent complicates how inbreeding will affect individual fitness, partly because we have -- by definition -- two different individuals to consider (a female and a male), but also because biparental inbreeding can occur between any number of different types of relatives (e.g., siblings, cousins, etc.). I'll explain these complications in more detail below, but first I want to note two important general points about inbreeding, the combination of which makes the evolution of inbreeding particularly interesting. 

The first point is that individuals that inbreed typically produce offspring that have lower fitness than individuals that outbreed (e.g., they have offspring with a lower probability of survival), a phenomenon called *''inbreeding depression''*. That inbreeding depression occurs is well-known, and I won't get into the details of what causes it [see Charlesworth1999; Charlesworth2009]. The second point is that despite the occurrence of inbreeding depression in inbred **offspring**, this does not necessarily mean that inbreeding **parents**  themselves have lower fitness than parents that avoid inbreeding. This second point isn't intuitive, and perhaps as a result of its counter-intuitiveness is widely under-appreciated, particularly when considering the evolution of animal behaviour. In what follows, I'll explain why selection can sometimes favour inbreeding instead of inbreeding avoidance despite inbreeding depression.





Want to briefly explain the key concept behind inbreeding theory as introduced by @Parker1979. Talk about the book itself being a good one, and that it is hard to find, and contains some of Bill Hamilton's excellent writing on fig wasps, which I used to study.

Outline, very casually, the kind of interaction being represented by @Parker1979 -- inviting the reader to imagine a drawn out scenario of focal individual encountering a relative (for the sake of argument, assume a sibling); what to do? Natural selection will favour behaviour that maximises the number of replica copies passed to offspring. In our simple case, there are two things to consider: 1) there are replica alleles in the potential mate, and 2) inbred offspring have lower survival probability than outbred offspring. Tell the story from the perspective of the focal individual -- then note how @Parker1979 explained the maths, but this has become expressed more generally in @Parker2006 and @Kokko2006 as the standard equation.

Walk through the isolation of $\delta$. Then, verbally, explain what this means -- one big insight that @Parker1979 provided was that inbreeding could be evolutionarily adaptive; this was already well-known in the context of self-fertilisation, but not widely appreciated among behavioural ecologists [@Kokko2006; @Szulkin2012].

Perhaps more interesting, @Parker1979 noted that reproductive interactions between relatives are expected to be characterised by sexual conflict (explain what this means) in a way that self-fertilisation versus outcrossing is not. Explain why this conflict arises, and that it links with other kinds of conflict, citing relevant sources here. Hence, in a few pages of @Parker1979, we have two key theoretical insights; inbreeding should sometimes be adaptive, and reproductive interactions between relatives should lead to sexual conflict.

Note how this work of @Parker1979 still remains less appreciated than perhaps it should, but interesting theory has been developed from its foundation. @Kokko2006 conceptualised the timing of interactions. @Puurtinen2011 (brief note to optimal inbreeding), I think, was the first to note subtely that females but not males could prefer inbreeding (explain why). The other paper on dispersal also boils down to @Parker1979, which was also expressed in a more general paper on sexual conflict in @Parker2006. Perhaps mention @Lehtonen2015 and @Waser1986, noting the costs. Then the conceptual unification between inbreeding theory and parental investment theory, and the model of population genetics.
