It is widely under-appreciated that active inbreeding -- and especially *biparental* inbreeding -- can be adaptive and therefore favoured by natural selection. Biparental inbreeding specifically refers to the situation in which two different, but genetically related, organisms breed and thereby produce inbred offspring. This situation differs from self-fertilisation, in which an organism inbreeds with itself, as is perhaps most commonly studied in plants [e.g., Barrett1996; @Vogler2001]. The addition of a second parent complicates how inbreeding will affect individual fitness, partly because we have -- by definition -- two different individuals to consider (a female and a male), but also because biparental inbreeding can occur between any number of different types of relatives (e.g., siblings, cousins, etc.). I'll explain these complications in more detail below, but first I want to note two important general points about inbreeding, the combination of which makes the evolution of inbreeding particularly interesting. 

The first point is that individuals that inbreed typically produce offspring that have lower fitness than individuals that outbreed (e.g., they have offspring with a lower probability of survival), a phenomenon called ''inbreeding depression''. That inbreeding depression occurs is well-known, and I won't get into the details of what causes it [see @Charlesworth1999; @Charlesworth2009]. The second point is that despite the occurrence of inbreeding depression in inbred **offspring**, this does not necessarily mean that inbreeding **parents**  themselves have lower fitness than parents that avoid inbreeding. This second point isn't intuitive, and was first articulated by Geoff @Parker1979 for the case of biparental inbreeding.


Parker's model of biparental inbreeding
----------------------------------------------------

The foundational work of biparental inbreeding theory developed by [Parker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoff_Parker) appears as a chapter in [*Sexual Selection and Reproductive Competition in Insects*](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Sexual-Selection-Reproductive-Competition-Insects/dp/0124145760) [@Parker1979] [1](#foot1). @Parker1979 considered an encounter and the subsequent reproductive decisions of two focal relatives [2](#foot2). Below, I'll show the logic of these reproductive decisions first for females, then for males.

Consider a focal female that can produce $n$ offspring -- the exact number doesn't matter for demonstrating the key point, so to keep things simple, we can start by assuming that this number will always be the same. This focal female encounters a first cousin, and upon the encounter must decide whether or not to inbreed with him. If she does not inbreed with him, then we'll assume that she is able to find some other male to breed with to whom she is not related. By avoiding inbreeding with her cousin and outbreeding instead, she will produce $n$ offspring that do not suffer any inbreeding depression. For simplicitly, we can set their fitness to a value of $1$, and think of this value as the probability that an outbred offspring survives to adulthood. If she instead inbreeds with her cousin, then she will produce $n$ offspring whose survival probability will be reduced by some value $\delta$ due to inbreeding depression. Hence, if the focal female outbreeds, then she will produce $n$ offspring with a survival probability of $1$. And if she inbreeds with her cousin, then she will produce $n$ offspring with a survival probability of $(1 - \delta)$. If we only consider the effects of inbreeding depression, then the $n \times 1$ surviving offspring that the focal female produces by outbreeding will always be favoured by selection over the $n \times (1 - \delta)$ surviving offspring produced by inbreeding, and the inequality

$$ n(1-\delta) > n  $$,

will never be true.

But the above inequality leaves out something important to inbreeding that affects fitness. **If the focal female chooses to inbreed with her cousin, then his reproductive success will be increased**. Hence, by inbreeding, she can increase the reproductive success of her relative, and thereby increase her fitness indirectly -- by how much depends on her *relatedness* to her potential mate. Assuming the focal female is herself outbred (i.e., that her own parents did not inbreed), then her cousin's relatedness to her will be $1/8$ [3](#foot3). She should therefore consider any additional reproductive success of her cousin that results from her decision with $1/8$ the weight of her own reproductive success. The indirect fitness accrued from the reproductive success of her cousin plus the direct fitness accrued from her own reproductive success defines her *inclusive fitness* as accrued through her reproductive decision; inclusive fitness, more generally, can be used to determine how selection will act on a particular behaviour [@Hamilton1964; @Grafen2006]. In the case of inbreeding, we can contrast the inclusive fitness accrued from inbreeding with that of outbreeding,

$$ n(1-\delta) + \frac{1}{8}n(1-\delta) > n $$.

Now, note that the above inequality isn't always false -- as it obviously was in the first inequality when indirect fitness was not taken into account. If we now imagine a very small value of $\delta$, then the left hand side of the above inequality will approach a value of $n + (1/8)n$, higher than the inclusive fitness of outbreeding ($n$). Yet a large value (close to 1) of $\delta$ will make the left hand side closer to zero. Whether inbreeding or avoiding inbreeding yields the highest inclusive fitness therefore clearly depends on the value of $\delta$. In fact, we can calculate the threshold value below which inbreeding increases inclusive fitness by isolating the above equation for $\delta$,

$$ n(1-\delta) + \frac{1}{8}n(1-\delta) > n $$

$$ (1-\delta) + \frac{1}{8}(1-\delta) > 1 $$

$$ 1 - \delta + \frac{1}{8} - \frac{1}{8}\delta > 1 $$

$$ 1 + \frac{1}{8} > 1 + \delta + \frac{1}{8}\delta $$

$$ \frac{1}{8} > \delta + \frac{1}{8}\delta $$

$$ \frac{1}{8} > (1 + \frac{1}{8})\delta $$

$$ \frac{1}{8} / (1 + \frac{1}{8}) > \delta $$

$$ \frac{1}{9} > \delta $$.

In our example, a focal female will increase her inclusive fitness more by inbreeding with her cousin than by avoiding inbreeding with him if $\delta$ is less than one ninth -- or, put differently, if her inbred offspring have an $8/9$ survival probability. **A focal female can thereby increase her inclusive fitness if inbreeding depression is sufficiently weak**.


<!--- Perhaps more interesting, @Parker1979 noted that reproductive interactions between relatives are expected to be characterised by sexual conflict (explain what this means) in a way that self-fertilisation versus outcrossing is not. Explain why this conflict arises, and that it links with other kinds of conflict, citing relevant sources here. Hence, in a few pages of @Parker1979, we have two key theoretical insights; inbreeding should sometimes be adaptive, and reproductive interactions between relatives should lead to sexual conflict. --->

<!--- Note how this work of @Parker1979 still remains less appreciated than perhaps it should, but interesting theory has been developed from its foundation. @Kokko2006 conceptualised the timing of interactions. @Puurtinen2011 (brief note to optimal inbreeding), I think, was the first to note subtely that females but not males could prefer inbreeding (explain why). The other paper on dispersal also boils down to @Parker1979, which was also expressed in a more general paper on sexual conflict in @Parker2006. Perhaps mention @Lehtonen2015 and @Waser1986, noting the costs. Then the conceptual unification between inbreeding theory and parental investment theory, and the model of population genetics. --->

<a name="foot1">[1]</a> As an aside, this is a wonderful book that also includes a chapter written by Bill Hamilton on wing dimorphism in male fig wasps, likening male-male competition within a fig to ''a darkened room full of jostling people among whom, or else lurking in cupboards and recesses which open on all sides, are a dozen or so maniacal homicides armed with knives'' [@Hamilton1979 p. 173].

<a name="foot2">[2]</a> @Parker1979 considered an encounter between a female and her full-sibling brother. I'm going to use cousins to deliberately produce an example with a different numerical result.

<a name="foot3">[3]</a> Specifically, her *coefficient of relatedness*; see, e.g., @Michod1979 or @Duthie2015a for more detail on how *relatedness* is calculated, particularly given inbreeding.
