Working with [arrays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array_data_structure) of data (e.g., numeric vectors and matrices) is routine for scientific researchers doing statistics or modelling. In programming languages with which most researchers are probably familiar (e.g., [R](https://www.r-project.org/), [python](https://www.python.org/), and [MATLAB](https://uk.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html)), setting values into a some sort of array is straightforward. In R, we can define a vector `data_vec` with one line of code.

```{r}
data_vec <- c(3, 5, 4, 1, 7, 6);
print(data_vec);
```

We can similarly define a two by two dimensional matrix.

```{r}
data_mat <- matrix(data = c(3, 5, 4, 1, 7, 6), nrow = 2, ncol = 3);
print(data_mat);
```

In C, this kind of assignment doesn't work, which can be intimidating at first for researchers new to the language. Instead, memory needs to be allocated appropriately using *pointers*, which identify where in a computer's memory variables are located. Thinking about and using pointers effectively can take a bit of getting used to, but being able to use C to do so can massively speed up computations [[1]](#foot1), making the investment worthwhile for researchers doing computationally intense statistical or simulation modeling. The intended audience of this post includes researchers who are newcomers to using C, or might be interested in learning C as means to speed up their analyses, perhaps through [integration with R](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/C-interface.html) (more on this in a future post). I'm not going to focus so much on how to code in C, but rather the logic of what pointers are and how they are used in the language, as this is a major learning curve when getting started.

All variables initialised in C need to be stored in some address in the computer's memory. We can think about the memory of a computer as a large block of locations where information can be stored. Each location specifies a single [byte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte), and blocks of bytes are used to store numeric values (Dennis Kubes discusses [Basics of memory addresses in C](http://denniskubes.com/2012/08/17/basics-of-memory-addresses-in-c/) in more detail). If we tell C to print off a set of locations, these are the kinds of values we get.

| Location 1 | Location 2 | Location 3 | Location 4 | Location 5 | Location 6 |
|------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|
| 0x7fc010   |  0x7fc011  | 0x7fc012   |  0x7fc013  | 0x7fc014   |  0x7fc015  |

The numbers above are in [hexidecimal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal), as indicated by the `0x` at the start of each. The numbers therefore start from 7fc010 at Location 1 and end at 7fc015 at Location 6. To make it easier to conceptualise, we can just replace these with their equivalent values in [base 10](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal).

| Location 1 | Location 2 | Location 3 | Location 4 | Location 5 | Location 6 |
|------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|
|  8372240   |  8372241   |  8372242   |  8372243   |  8372244   |  8372245   |

So we have a block of addresses where variable values can be stored. This is all that we get to work with in C. There is no inherent structure for representing arrays in C, so if we want to put numbers into an array of one or more dimensions, then we need to create an array ourselves. We can do this in C is using the `malloc` function in the [C standard library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_standard_library) to set aside blocks of memory for multiple numeric values. I'll get to how to do this below, but first I need to explain how pointers are initialised in C. When assigning a single number to a variable, it is not necessary to allocate memory explicitly. For example, we can define an integer `int variable_1` and assign it to a value of `variable_1 = 10`. The very [short program](https://github.com/bradduthie/blog/blob/gh-pages/code/c_pointer_eg/variable_eg.c) below does this and prints out a value of 10 before exiting.

```
#include<stdio.h>

int main(void){

    int variable_1;
    variable_1 = 3;
    printf("\n Value of variable_1 is %d \n", variable_1);

    return 0;
}
```

The `#include<stdio.h>` tells the [compiler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler) to add the necessary code for standard input and output functions (in this case `printf`), and the program is compiled by running the below on the command line from within the directory that the program is saved.

```
gcc -Wall variable_eg.c -o variable_eg
```

The program `variable_eg` that is produced by compiling the above is run below.

```
./variable_eg
```

And the output of the `variable_eg` is shown below.

```
Value of variable_1 is 3 
```

Storing the values of a one-dimensional array
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The above is simple enough for storing a single number, but if we want to store an array, we need to initialise a *pointer* -- that is, a *variable that contains an address in the computer's memory*. This address will 'point' to the location of the values of interest; specifically, it will point to the first location in a block of addresses that can store multiple numeric values. Each element in the array will occupy a single address. To initialise a pointer, we need to use the [dereference operator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dereference_operator), which in C is an asterisk (this might seem confusing at first because `*` performs two functions in C -- dereferencing and multiplying, but the context makes it easy to tell the two uses apart). When seeing an asterisk in front of a variable, it can be read as 'the value at', so `*pointer_1` is 'the value at location `pointer_1`'.  We can intialise a pointer of [data type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_data_types) `double` in C as follows [[2]](#foot2).

```
double *pointer_1;
```

We can think of the above instruction as 'initialise a value of type double at location pointer_1'. To start assigning numbers to an array, we need to define how many blocks of size `double` need to be allocated using the function `malloc`. As an example, we'll start with a simple one dimensional array of size 6.

```
pointer_1 = malloc(6 * sizeof(double));
```

In the above, we've told C to allocate a block of memory starting at the location `pointer_1`, and extending to a length the size of six `double` values. The `sizeof` operator, as you might expect, [returns a value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sizeof) indicating how much memory the data type takes to store. This will allow us to place six `double` values in a vector at a location in the memory starting at `pointer_1`. For the sake of argument, let's assume that `pointer_1 = 8372240`, and so equals the same address as in the earlier example.

|         | Location 1 | Location 2 | Location 3 | Location 4 | Location 5 |  Location 6 |
|---------|------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|-------------|
| Address |  8372240   |  8372241   |  8372242   |  8372243   |  8372244   |  8372245    |

Note that 8372240 is the address of `pointer_1` in **Location 1**; the **value** at this location is `*pointer_1` (which we haven't yet assigned). Using `malloc` in the code above, we have allocated the six locations 8372240-8372245 for use in our array. If we want to assign a value in the location, we can use the dereference operator.

```
*pointer_1 = 3;
```

The value stored in location `pointer_1` is now 3. To store values in the other five locations that we've allocated for use, we can simply add one to the value of the location with the dereference operator. In this case, the address of **Location 2** in the table above is simply one more than the value of `pointer_1` itself, `pointer + 1`. So we can put a value in the this location in the same way by indicating the correct address.

```
*(pointer_1 + 1) = 5;
```

The above stores the value five in **Location 2** of the example table above. On the left hand side of the equation, we can read this as the 'value at the location pointer_1 plus one'. The parentheses tells C to compute `pointer_1 + 1` before applying the dereference operator, so the correct address is identified within parentheses and dereferenced with the asterisk outside of them. We can assign six random values and print them using [the function below](https://github.com/bradduthie/blog/blob/gh-pages/code/c_pointer_eg/array_eg_1.c) (the standard library `stdlib.h` includes code needed for memory allocation functions `malloc` and `free`).

```
#include<stdio.h>
#include<stdlib.h>

int main(void){

    int i;
    double *pointer_1;
    
    pointer_1 = malloc(6 * sizeof(double));
    
    *pointer_1       = 3;
    *(pointer_1 + 1) = 5;
    *(pointer_1 + 2) = 4;
    *(pointer_1 + 3) = 1;
    *(pointer_1 + 4) = 7;
    *(pointer_1 + 5) = 6;
    
    for(i = 0; i < 6; i++){
        printf("%f\n", *(pointer_1 + i));
    }

    free(pointer_1);

    return 0;
}
```

We can represent the above in a table again below that includes address and values stored in each address, using the pointers to represent the addresses of variables but keeping in mind that each increment of `pointer_1` corresonds to some integer number that maps to a block of the computer's memory.

|         | Location 1      | Location 2      | Location 3      | Location 4      | Location 5      |  Location 6     |
|---------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Address | `pointer_1 + 0` | `pointer_1 + 1` | `pointer_1 + 2` | `pointer_1 + 3` | `pointer_1 + 4` | `pointer_1 + 5` |
| Value   |       3         |       5         |         4       |       1         |         7       |        6        |


After allocating memory with `malloc`, it is important to free the memory using `free` when it is no longer needed to avoid a [memory leak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_leak). A memory leak occurs when addresses are allocated but not freed, and the number of available places to store data decreases. Upon freeing memory, new values could be stored in the addresses above. 

Note how there are six elements in the array, but the last element in the array is `*(pointer_1 + 5)` because the array effectively starts at `*(pointer + 0)`. Arrays in C are [zero indexed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-based_numbering); the first element starts with zero and ends with a value of one less than the total length of the array. This takes some getting used to for many researchers who learned to code in R, but it also makes the logic of `for` loops a bit more intuitive, as is clear from the function above. This also brings me to the short-hand bracket notation for using arrays in C. An easier way to write `*(pointer_1 + element)` is simply `pointer_1[element]`. 

Hence, we can usually think about an array that we create in C *as if* `array_1[i]` means 'the `i`th element of the array `array_1`', but it it's useful to keep in mind that what it *really* refers to is 'the value at the memory location `array_1 + i`'. With this in mind, we can [re-write the above program](https://github.com/bradduthie/blog/blob/gh-pages/code/c_pointer_eg/array_eg_2.c) as follows, swapping the variable name `pointer_1` with `array_1`.

```
#include<stdio.h>
#include<stdlib.h>

int main(void){

    int i;
    double *array_1;
    
    pointer_1 = malloc(6 * sizeof(double));
    
    array_1[0] = 3;
    array_1[1] = 5;
    array_1[2] = 4;
    array_1[3] = 1;
    array_1[4] = 7;
    array_1[5] = 6;
    
    for(i = 0; i < 6; i++){
        printf("%f\n", array_1[i]);
    }

    free(array_1);

    return 0;
}
```

The above certainly looks a bit cleaner. The usefulness of the short-hand bracket notation becomes even clearer when working with multi-dimensional arrays, which I will briefly discuss next.

Multi-dimensional arrays in C
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Like one-dimensional arrays, there is no built-in way to tell C that we want to make a multi-dimensional array; we need to use pointers. Even more complicated, there is also no simple way to tell C which pointers should correspond to which dimensions of our array, so we need to remove ourselves yet another level from the actual array element values and define *pointers to pointers*. For example, if we want to allocate memory into a two dimensional array, we need to define a pointer that points to the first address where we want each row [[3]](#foot3) to be. So let's say that instead of making a one dimensional array of six elements, what we really want is a two dimensional array with two rows and three columns. To do this, we need to first allocate memory to hold a set of *pointers*, and have each of those pointers hold values that themselves are pointers to where we want the start of each row in our array to be. I've drawn this one out below in hopes of making things clearer.

![Figure 1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bradduthie/blog/gh-pages/figures/2D_array_eg_pointers.png?token=AFSziUofzo5hxGJv2197hNbrm1d8dKoKks5Y_SPcwA%3D%3D)

In the above, the pointer to a pointer `**array2D` is a variable that holds two values at addresses `7ffef08a8978` and `7ffef08a879`. The two values it holds are `150b010` and `150b013`, which are the addresses of the element in the *first column* of the first and second rows of the array. The *values* stored by `**array2D` are the *addresses* of `*(array2D + 0)` and `*(array2D + 1)`. So the array will look like the below.

|       | Column 1  |  Column 2 | Column 3 |
|-------|-----------|-----------|----------|
| Row 1 |   3       |    5      |    4     |
| Row 2 |   1       |    7      |    6     |

To walk through what has happened once more verbally, we have initialised a pointer to a pointer `**array2D` of length 2. This pointer to a pointer stores two values that correspond to the addresses of the first element of each row of the array. Each row of the array then holds 3 values for each column; to get this to work, we have to allocate memory for each row separately, which can be done using [the code below](https://github.com/bradduthie/blog/blob/gh-pages/code/c_pointer_eg/array_eg_2D.c).


```
#include<stdio.h>
#include<stdlib.h>

int main(void){
  
  int row,  col;
  int row_number, col_number;
  double **array2D;
  
  row_number = 2;
  col_number = 3;
  
  array2D = malloc(row_number * sizeof(double *));
  for(row = 0; row < row_number; row++){
      *(array2D + row) = malloc(col_number * sizeof(double));
  }
  
  *(*(array2D + 0) + 0) = 3;
  *(*(array2D + 0) + 1) = 5;
  *(*(array2D + 0) + 2) = 4;
  *(*(array2D + 1) + 0) = 1;
  *(*(array2D + 1) + 1) = 7;
  *(*(array2D + 1) + 2) = 6;

  for(row = 0; row < row_number; row++){
    for(col = 0; col < col_number; col++){
      printf("%f\t", *(*(array2D + row) + col) );
    }
    printf("\n");
  }
  
  for(row = 0; row < row_number; row++){
    free(*(array2D + row));
  }
  free(array2D);
  
  return 0;
}
```

In the above, `malloc(row_number * size(double *))` tells C that we're allocating memory to store `row_number` pointers to `double` values. In the first `for` loop immediately below, we allocate `col_number` values of size `double` for each `*(array2D + row)`, blocking off an appropriate amount of memory for the length of each row. Note that when freeing the allocated memory, we can't just use `free(array2D)`. Since we allocated memory for `array2D` **and** each row `*(array2D + row)`, we need to free each chunk of memory allocated. Further, memory allocation to the individual rows must be freed before `array2D` is freed, or else C won't be able to find `*(array2D + row)` addresses to free them.

I assigned values to array elements without using brackets to break down what's going on in terms of pointers, but in practice it is much easier to [write this with brackets](https://github.com/bradduthie/blog/blob/gh-pages/code/c_pointer_eg/array_eg_2D_2.c) again. 

```
#include<stdio.h>
#include<stdlib.h>

int main(void){
  
  int row,  col;
  int row_number, col_number;
  double **array2D;
  
  row_number = 2;
  col_number = 3;
  
  array2D = malloc(row_number * sizeof(double *));
  for(row = 0; row < row_number; row++){
      array2D[row] = malloc(col_number * sizeof(double));
  }
  
  array2D[0][0] = 3;
  array2D[0][1] = 5;
  array2D[0][2] = 4;
  array2D[1][0] = 1;
  array2D[1][1] = 7;
  array2D[1][2] = 6;

  for(row = 0; row < row_number; row++){
    for(col = 0; col < col_number; col++){
      printf("%f\t", array2D[row][col] );
    }
    printf("\n");
  }
  
  for(row = 0; row < row_number; row++){
    free(array2D[row]);
  }
  free(array2D);
  
  return 0;
}
```

Conveniently, we can read `array2D[1][2] = 6` as 'row 1, column 2 of array2D equals size', but as with the one dimensional array example, it helps to remember that we are using the dereference operator twice to find the location at which the value is located.

A quick note about &
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In most introductions to pointers, the ampersand `&` operator is introduced alongside the asterisk `*`. I've not done so here because most code for simple scientific computing doesn't really need it (I've only used it a handful of times in several years of coding in C), but I should mention how it is used. The `&` identifies the address of a variable, so we can read `&variable_1` as 'the address of variable_1'. So, for example, if we set `variable_1 = 3`, we could set the pointer `*ptr_variable_1` to equal the address of `variable_1`, `&variable_1`.

```
#include<stdio.h>

int main(void){

    int variable_1, *ptr_variable_1;
    
    variable_1     = 3;
    ptr_variable_1 = &variable_1;
    
    printf("Value of variable_1 is %d \n", variable_1);
    printf("Address of variable_1 is %d \n", &variable_1);
    printf("Value of ptr_variable_1 is %d \n", ptr_variable_1);

    return 0;
}
```

The [above code](https://github.com/bradduthie/blog/blob/gh-pages/code/c_pointer_eg/ampersand_eg.c) prints the below.

```
Value of variable_1 is 3 
Address of variable_1 is 0x7fff17e1b3fc 
Value of ptr_variable_1 is 0x7fff17e1b3fc 
```

Note that we have set the value of `ptr_variable_1` to address `variable_1`.


Concluding remarks
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This was just a very brief introduction to the logic of pointers and how to use them to make arrays in C. It is not [everything you need to know about pointers](http://boredzo.org/pointers/), but a starting point for being able to work with data in C. My hope is that this explanation will complement other introductions to pointers in a way that will be especially useful for scientists who do not come from a computing background, and who have perhaps avoided making the jump to C from languages such as R, python, or MATLAB in part due to the pointers learning curve.

<a name="foot1">[1]</a> This is especially true for researchers coding in R for computationally intense tasks that include multiple loops. Running an individual-based model can be 10 to 100 times faster in C than it is in R or MATLAB, which I was surprised to find out while writing [the code](https://github.com/bradduthie/Duthie_and_Falcy_2013) for what would become the [first chapter](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304380013000021) of my doctoral dissertation. Since then, I do about half my coding in R, shifting to C whenever something needs to run fast.

<a name="foot2">[2]</a> Double is a precise type of value that can represent real numbers appropriately for most tasks in scientific computing. If only integer values are needed, use `int` instead, which is exact and uses less memory.

<a name="foot3">[3]</a> Technically, it doesn't necessarily have to be the first element of the *row*, but I usually do this way out of habit.
