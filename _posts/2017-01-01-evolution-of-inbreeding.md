It is widely under-appreciated that active inbreeding -- and especially
*biparental* inbreeding -- can be adaptive and therefore favoured by
natural selection. Biparental inbreeding specifically refers to the
situation in which two different, but genetically related, organisms
breed and thereby produce inbred offspring. This situation differs from
self-fertilisation, in which an organism inbreeds with itself, as is
perhaps most commonly studied in plants (e.g., Barrett1996; Vogler and
Kalisz 2001). The addition of a second parent complicates how inbreeding
will affect individual fitness, partly because we have -- by definition
-- two different individuals to consider (a female and a male), but also
because biparental inbreeding can occur between any number of different
types of relatives (e.g., siblings, cousins, etc.). I'll explain these
complications in more detail below, but first I want to note two
important general points about inbreeding, the combination of which
makes the evolution of inbreeding particularly interesting.

The first point is that individuals that inbreed typically produce
offspring that have lower fitness than individuals that outbreed (e.g.,
they have offspring with a lower probability of survival), a phenomenon
called ''inbreeding depression''. That inbreeding depression occurs is
well-known, and I won't get into the details of what causes it (see B.
Charlesworth and Charlesworth 1999; Charlesworth and Willis 2009). The
second point is that despite the occurrence of inbreeding depression in
inbred **offspring**, this does not necessarily mean that inbreeding
**parents** themselves have lower fitness than parents that avoid
inbreeding. This second point isn't intuitive, and was first articulated
by Geoff Parker (1979) for the case of biparental inbreeding.

Parker's model of biparental inbreeding
---------------------------------------

The foundational work of biparental inbreeding theory developed by
[Parker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoff_Parker) appears as a
chapter<sup>[1](#foot1)</sup> in [*Sexual Selection and Reproductive
Competition in
Insects*](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Sexual-Selection-Reproductive-Competition-Insects/dp/0124145760)
(Parker 1979). Since

Consider a focal female that can produce *n* offspring -- the exact
number doesn't matter for demonstrating the key point, so to keep things
simple, we can start by assuming that this number will always be the
same. This focal female encounters a first cousin<sup>[2](#foot2)</sup>,
and upon the encounter must decide whether or not to inbreed with him.
If she does not inbreed with him, then we'll assume that she is able to
find some other male to breed with to whom she is not related. By
avoiding inbreeding with her cousin and outbreeding instead, she will
produce *n* offspring that do not suffer any inbreeding depression. For
simplicitly, we can set their fitness to a value of 1, and think of this
value as the probability that an outbred offspring survives to
adulthood. If she instead inbreeds with her cousin, then she will
produce *n* offspring whose survival probability will be reduced by some
value *δ* due to inbreeding depression. Hence, if the focal female
outbreeds, then she will produce *n* offspring with a survival
probability of 1. And if she inbreeds with her cousin, then she will
produce *n* offspring with a survival probability of (1 − *δ*).

Want to briefly explain the key concept behind inbreeding theory as
introduced by Parker (1979). Talk about the book itself being a good
one, and that it is hard to find, and contains some of Bill Hamilton's
excellent writing on fig wasps, which I used to study.

Outline, very casually, the kind of interaction being represented by
Parker (1979) -- inviting the reader to imagine a drawn out scenario of
focal individual encountering a relative (for the sake of argument,
assume a sibling); what to do? Natural selection will favour behaviour
that maximises the number of replica copies passed to offspring. In our
simple case, there are two things to consider: 1) there are replica
alleles in the potential mate, and 2) inbred offspring have lower
survival probability than outbred offspring. Tell the story from the
perspective of the focal individual -- then note how Parker (1979)
explained the maths, but this has become expressed more generally in
Parker (2006) and Kokko and Ots (2006) as the standard equation.

Walk through the isolation of *δ*. Then, verbally, explain what this
means -- one big insight that Parker (1979) provided was that inbreeding
could be evolutionarily adaptive; this was already well-known in the
context of self-fertilisation, but not widely appreciated among
behavioural ecologists (Kokko and Ots 2006; Szulkin et al. 2013).

Perhaps more interesting, Parker (1979) noted that reproductive
interactions between relatives are expected to be characterised by
sexual conflict (explain what this means) in a way that
self-fertilisation versus outcrossing is not. Explain why this conflict
arises, and that it links with other kinds of conflict, citing relevant
sources here. Hence, in a few pages of Parker (1979), we have two key
theoretical insights; inbreeding should sometimes be adaptive, and
reproductive interactions between relatives should lead to sexual
conflict.

Note how this work of Parker (1979) still remains less appreciated than
perhaps it should, but interesting theory has been developed from its
foundation. Kokko and Ots (2006) conceptualised the timing of
interactions. Puurtinen (2011) (brief note to optimal inbreeding), I
think, was the first to note subtely that females but not males could
prefer inbreeding (explain why). The other paper on dispersal also boils
down to Parker (1979), which was also expressed in a more general paper
on sexual conflict in Parker (2006). Perhaps mention Lehtonen and Kokko
(2015) and Waser, Austad, and Keane (1986), noting the costs. Then the
conceptual unification between inbreeding theory and parental investment
theory, and the model of population genetics.

a female and her full-sibling brother. I'm using cousins to deliberately
produce an example with a different numerical result.
